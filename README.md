# -Dropout-experiment-on-Fashion-Mnist-Dataset

The Fashion-MNIST dataset is a popular benchmark dataset consisting of 70,000 images of 10 different clothing categories. In this experiment, we will use dropout regularization to improve the performance of a neural network on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

Dropout regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. It works by randomly dropping out (setting to zero) some of the neurons in the network during training. This prevents the network from relying too heavily on any one neuron and encourages it to learn more robust features.

To conduct this experiment, we will first load the Fashion-MNIST dataset using Keras. We will then build a neural network with two hidden layers and apply dropout regularization to the second hidden layer. Finally, we will train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set.


In this code, we first load the Fashion-MNIST dataset and preprocess the data by reshaping it and scaling it to be between 0 and 1. We then build the neural network with two hidden layers and apply dropout regularization with a rate of 0.2 to the second hidden layer. We compile the model with the RMSprop optimizer and train it for 20 epochs with a batch size of 128. Finally, we evaluate the model on the test set and print the test loss and accuracy.

You can adjust the dropout rate and the number of epochs to see how it affects the performance of the model. You can also add more layers or adjust the size of the hidden layers to see if it improves the performance of the model.



Sure, here's a step-by-step explanation of the dropout experiment on the Fashion-MNIST dataset:

Import necessary packages: We start by importing the necessary packages, including Keras for loading and working with the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and other packages such as NumPy and Matplotlib for data processing and visualization.
python
import keras
from keras.datasets import fashion_mnist
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from keras.optimizers import RMSprop

- Load the Fashion-MNIST dataset: We use Keras to load the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of 10 different clothing categories.
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

- Preprocess the data: We preprocess the data by reshaping the images from a 2D array of 28x28 pixels to a 1D array of 784 pixels. We also normalize the pixel values to be between 0 and 1, and convert the labels to categorical format using one-hot encoding.
x_train = x_train.reshape(60000, 784)
x_test = x_test.reshape(10000, 784)
x_train = x_train.astype('float32')
x_test = x_test.astype('float32')
x_train /= 255
x_test /= 255
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, 10)

- Build the neural network: We build a neural network with two hidden layers, each consisting of 512 neurons and using the ReLU activation function. We also add a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 to the second hidden layer to prevent overfitting. Finally, we add an output layer with 10 neurons and using the softmax activation function for multi-class classification.
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))
model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

- Compile the model: We compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics. We use the categorical cross-entropy loss function for multi-class classification, the RMSprop optimizer, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=RMSprop(),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

- Train the model: We train the model on the training set with a batch size of 128 and for 20 epochs. We also specify the validation data to evaluate the model after each epoch.
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train,
                    batch_size=128,
                    epochs=20,
                    verbose=1,
                    validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
                    
- Evaluate the model: We evaluate the model on the test set and print the test loss and accuracy.
score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print('Test loss:', score[0])
print('Test accuracy:', score[1])

- Overall, the dropout experiment on the Fashion-MNIST dataset involves loading and preprocessing the data, building and compiling a neural network with dropout regularization, training the model on the training set, and evaluating its performance on the test set. The use of dropout regularization can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.
